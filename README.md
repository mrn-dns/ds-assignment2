### Phase 1.

[ List the Lambda functions in this phase's architecture and state their working status - Fully implemented / Partially working / Not implemented. For partially working lambdas, state briefly what is defective in their implementation.]

e.g.

+ Confirmation Mailer - Fully implemented.
+ Rejection Mailer - Partially working. The Lambda is triggered at the correct times, but the emails are not being received.
+ Log Image -  Fully implemented. 

### Phase 2 (if relevant).

[ List the Lambda functions in this phase's architecture and state their working status - Fully implemented / Partially working / Not implemented. For partially working lambdas, state briefly what is defective in their implementation.]

e.g.

+ Confirmation Mailer - Partially working. The lambda is triggered too often. The image metadata messages are not being filtered out as required.
+ Rejection Mailer - Fully implemented 
+ Log Image - Fully implemented 
+ Update Table -  Fully implemented.

### Phase 3 (if relevant).

[ List the Lambda functions in this phase's architecture and state their working status - Fully implemented / Partially working / Not implemented. For partially working lambdas, state briefly what is defective in their implementation.]

e.g.

+ Confirmation Mailer - Not implemented.
+ Process Image - Fully implemented.
+ Update Table - Fully implemented.
+ etc
+ etc
